# FullPage.js implementation in React
The app is bootstrapped with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), there is a super simple implementation of [fullPage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) by [Alvaro Trigo](https://twitter.com/imac2).

> This should be a playground project to mess around with state in the fullPage.js React wrapper.
